    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 08 December 2024</p>
    <p>This document explains how <strong>Land Manifest</strong> (the &quot;App&quot;) provided by <strong>Ravania Technology</strong> (&quot;we&quot;) collects, uses, and protects user information. By using the App, you agree to this policy.</p>

    <h2>Legal Bases</h2>
