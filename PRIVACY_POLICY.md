Last updated: 08 December 2024

This document explains how **Land Manifest** (the "App") provided by **Ravania Technology** ("we") collects, uses, and protects user information. By using the App, you agree to this policy.

## Information We Collect

- **Account data**: name, email address, and login information you provide voluntarily.
- **Usage data**: in-app interactions, crash logs, and performance metrics to improve the service.
- **Device data**: device model, operating system, language, time zone, and advertising ID (if enabled).
- **Location**: only with your permission; used for features that require location.
- **Media/files**: only with your permission; used to upload or process content you choose.

## How We Use Information

- Provide, maintain, and improve App features.
- Personalize user experience and content recommendations.
- Prevent, detect, and address fraud or misuse.
- Send service-related communications (updates, security, or support).

## Legal Bases

We process data based on (i) your consent, (ii) the necessity to provide requested services, or (iii) our legitimate interests to improve the App while respecting your privacy rights.

## Sharing Information

- **Service providers**: we may share data with vendors supporting technical operations, analytics, or customer support under confidentiality obligations.
- **Legal compliance**: we may disclose data when required by law or to protect rights, safety, and compliance with our policies.

## App Permissions

If the App requests permissions (e.g., camera, microphone, location, storage), access is used only to deliver the relevant features and can be disabled in your device settings.

## Data Retention

Data is retained as long as needed for the purposes collected or as required by law. You may request deletion as described under "Your Rights."

## Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect your data. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Children

The App is not directed to children under 13 (or applicable local age). We do not knowingly collect data from children under that age. If you are a parent/guardian and believe your child provided data, contact us for deletion.

## Your Rights

You may:

- Access, update, or correct your information.
- Withdraw consent (effective moving forward) without affecting prior processing.
- Request deletion of data that can be legally erased.
- Object to certain processing or request restriction where applicable by law.

Submit requests via the contact details below.

## International Transfers

If data is processed outside your country, we will ensure adequate protection as required by applicable law.

## Analytics and Ads

If we use analytics or advertising tools (e.g., Google Analytics for Firebase), advertising ID and usage data may be processed for performance measurement. You can opt out of interest-based ads via your device settings or Google Ads settings.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy periodically. Material changes will be communicated through the App or your registered email.
